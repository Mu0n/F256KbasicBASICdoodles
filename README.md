Foenix Retro Systems is a homebrew effort to bring 8/16/32-bit era processors in a new, reimagined retro series of computer designed by Stefany Allaire (https://twitter.com/StefanyAllaire)

## SuperBASIC 'basic doodles'
These simple examples in basic are my first steps into discovering the machine and its graphic, sound and input capabilities.

To run these, simply copy them over (probably using an SD card) and load them with `load 'program name.bas'` followed by `run`. When you're done, just hit `CTRL-C` to break execution from an infinite loop.

## BlinkBlue

Very simple code that toggles the Bit[2] (L0) from the Sys0 register (at $D6A0), which will make the SD card access blue LED blink

## DancingValk

Using a pre-compiled sprite object from Ernesto Contreras' demo project in basic, along with its default palette file

### Files that are expected in the same directory:

* `dance.bas`
* `default.pal`
* `valkyre.bspr`

### Controls
Use the joystick in port 2 to move around and dance (using the fire button) or control with the keyboard with 'Z' and 'X' for left and right and 'K' and 'M' for up and down and 'L' to dance (fire).
